                <p>Ramanujan (literally, "younger brother of Rama", a Hindu deity[14] was born on 22 December 1887 into a Tamil Brahmin Iyengar family in Erode during the British Colonial Rule (present-day Tamil Nadu, India), at the residence of his maternal grandparents.[15] His father, Kuppuswamy Srinivasa Iyengar, originally from Thanjavur district, worked as a clerk in a sari shop.[16][2] His mother, Komalatammal, was a housewife and sang at a local temple.[17] They lived in a small traditional home on Sarangapani Sannidhi Street in the town of Kumbakonam.[18] The family home is now a museum. When Ramanujan was a year and a half old, his mother gave birth to a son, Sadagopan, who died less than three months later. In December 1889, Ramanujan contracted smallpox, but recovered, unlike the 4,000 others who died in a bad year in the Thanjavur district around this time. He moved with his mother to her parents' house in Kanchipuram, near Madras (now Chennai). His mother gave birth to two more children, in 1891 and 1894, both of whom died before their first birthdays.</p>

                   <p> On 1 October 1892, Ramanujan was enrolled at the local school.[19] After his maternal grandfather lost his job as a court official in Kanchipuram,[20] Ramanujan and his mother moved back to Kumbakonam, and he was enrolled in Kangayan Primary School.[21] When his paternal grandfather died, he was sent back to his maternal grandparents, then living in Madras. He did not like school in Madras, and tried to avoid attending. His family enlisted a local constable to make sure he attended school. Within six months, Ramanujan was back in Kumbakonam.</p>
                    
                   <p>Since Ramanujan's father was at work most of the day, his mother took care of the boy, and they had a close relationship. From her, he learned about tradition and puranas, to sing religious songs, to attend pujas at the temple, and to maintain particular eating habitsâ€”all part of Brahmin culture.[22] At Kangayan Primary School, Ramanujan performed well. Just before turning 10, in November 1897, he passed his primary examinations in English, Tamil, geography, and arithmetic with the best scores in the district.[23] That year, Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.[23]</p>
